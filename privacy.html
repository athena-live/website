          <li>
            <strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information to comply with applicable laws, regulations,

      <section class="card">
        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service,
          fulfill contractual obligations, comply with legal requirements, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
          We may retain cached or backup copies for a limited period consistent with our business continuity practices.

      <section class="card">
        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information, including
          encryption in transit, access controls, segmented infrastructure, and monitoring. No security measures are
          infallible, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
          your account credentials and for promptly notifying us of any suspected unauthorized access.

        <h2>7. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We use cookies, web beacons, local storage, and similar technologies to provide the Service, maintain sessions,
          measure performance, and deliver relevant content. You may adjust browser settings to limit cookies, but doing so
          may impact functionality. Some browsers offer Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals; when detected, we treat them
          as a request to opt out of sale or sharing where legally required.

          understand that your information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the United States or other
          countries where our service providers operate. Those jurisdictions may have privacy laws that differ from your
          home jurisdiction, and by using the Service you consent to these transfers and processing.
