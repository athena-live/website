        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service,

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information, including
          encryption in transit, access controls, segmented infrastructure, and monitoring. No security measures are
          infallible, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
          your account credentials and for promptly notifying us of any suspected unauthorized access.

        <h2>7. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We use cookies, web beacons, local storage, and similar technologies to provide the Service, maintain sessions,
          measure performance, and deliver relevant content. You may adjust browser settings to limit cookies, but doing so
          may impact functionality. Some browsers offer Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals; when detected, we treat them
          as a request to opt out of sale or sharing where legally required.
