        <p class="meta">
          These Terms govern your access to and use of Athena’s websites, applications, APIs, portals, and related
          services (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
          If you do not agree, do not access or use the Service.
        </p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old and legally capable of entering into contracts. By using the Service, you
          represent and warrant that you meet these requirements. Athena may request proof of eligibility at any time and
          may suspend or terminate access if eligibility cannot be verified to our satisfaction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information when registering for an account and to update
          such information as needed. You are solely responsible for safeguarding your credentials and for all activity
          that occurs under your account. Notify Athena immediately at
          <a href="mailto:legal@athena.live">legal@athena.live</a> if you suspect unauthorized use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Athena may refuse, suspend, or terminate your account at its sole discretion for any reason, including suspected
          misuse, violation of these Terms, or if continued access would expose Athena to risk or liability.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>3. Use of the Service</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is a curated professional networking and job intelligence platform. You will comply with all
          applicable laws and refrain from activities that could harm Athena, its users, or partners. Prohibited conduct
          includes, without limitation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Impersonating any person or entity or misrepresenting your affiliation;</li>
          <li>Posting, transmitting, or soliciting false, misleading, defamatory, or unlawful content;</li>
          <li>Scraping, crawling, data harvesting, or using bots or automated systems without prior written consent;</li>
          <li>Reverse engineering, decompiling, copying, framing, or redistributing any part of the Service;</li>
          <li>Attempting to interfere with, disrupt, or compromise the integrity or security of the Service;</li>
          <li>Accessing content or data through unauthorized means or bypassing rate limits or access controls.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Athena reserves the right, but not the obligation, to monitor, remove, or restrict any content or activity that
          violates these Terms or exposes Athena to liability.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>4. Content Ownership and License</h2>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of the content, data, and materials you submit (“User Content”). By submitting User Content,
          you grant Athena a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, transferable, royalty-free license to host,
          store, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and
          otherwise use the User Content for any purpose related to servicing, operating, promoting, and improving the
          Service, including derivative works and commercial purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant this license and that your User Content
          does not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights. Athena
          may use aggregated and anonymized data derived from User Content for analytics, product development, artificial
          intelligence model training, marketing, and other legitimate business purposes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>5. Job Listings and Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Employers, recruiters, and partners are solely responsible for the accuracy, legality, and compliance of their
          job postings, outreach, and hiring practices. Athena does not guarantee the availability, compensation, timeline,
          or outcome of any job opportunity, nor does Athena verify employer representations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Candidates are responsible for evaluating the legitimacy of job opportunities and for complying with applicable
          laws, including employment, immigration, and tax regulations. Athena is not a party to, and bears no liability
          for, any employment or contractor relationship established between users.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>6. Payments and Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>
          Certain features may require payment of fees. By purchasing a paid feature, you agree to pay the fees disclosed
          at checkout, including all applicable taxes. All payments are non-refundable unless required by law or expressly
          stated otherwise in writing by Athena. Athena may change pricing, payment terms, or bundled offerings at any
          time, with changes taking effect upon posting to the Service or upon notice to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If recurring billing applies, you authorize Athena (and our third-party payment processors) to automatically
          charge your payment method until you cancel pursuant to the applicable terms. Failure to pay may result in
          suspension or termination of access to paid features.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ATHENA DISCLAIMS ALL
          WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
          A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ATHENA DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE
          UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR THAT CONTENT OR DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, OR COMPLETE.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that any reliance on information, listings, or communications obtained through the Service is at
          your sole risk. Athena does not vet or endorse users, employers, or opportunities unless explicitly stated in
          writing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ATHENA, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
          LICENSORS, AND PARTNERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
          PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, ARISING OUT OF
          OR RELATED TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
          NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ATHENA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
          DAMAGES.
        </p>
        <p>
          ATHENA’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER
          OF (A) ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100) OR (B) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO ATHENA FOR THE SERVICE IN THE TWELVE (12)
          MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Athena, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and
          licensors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’
          fees) arising out of or in any way connected with (a) your access to or use of the Service, (b) your User Content,
          or (c) your violation of these Terms or applicable law. Athena reserves the right to assume control of the
          defense of any matter subject to indemnification, in which case you will cooperate with our defense and
          settlement strategy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>10. Suspension and Termination</h2>
        <p>
          Athena may suspend or terminate your access to the Service immediately, with or without notice, if we determine
          that you have violated these Terms, pose a risk to Athena or other users, or if providing the Service is no
          longer commercially viable. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases, but Sections 4, 7, 8, 9, 11,
          12, and any other provisions that by their nature should survive will remain in effect.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>11. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms and any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to them or the Service are governed
          by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The United Nations
          Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          All disputes shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration administered by the American
          Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in Los Angeles County, California, in English, pursuant to the AAA Commercial
          Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration
          agreement. You waive the right to participate in a class, collective, or representative action, and the parties
          agree the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, Athena may seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent
          jurisdiction to protect its confidential information, intellectual property, or to prevent unauthorized access to
          or use of the Service.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>12. Compliance and Export Controls</h2>
        <p>
          You represent that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country or
          jurisdiction subject to U.S. embargo or designated by the U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country,
          and you are not listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You agree to comply with
          all U.S. and international export and sanctions laws and regulations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          Athena may modify these Terms at any time. We will post the updated Terms on this page with a revised “Last
          Updated” date. Changes take effect immediately upon posting unless a later effective date is specified. Your
          continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
